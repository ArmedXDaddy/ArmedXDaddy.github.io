                    <p class = "para">Hey chum Happy 19th Birthday. Well at least By the time of when I started creating this (August 12th), I am planning to show this to you on your Birthday. I wrote these open when letters for you. Pretty simple. I hope when you read them, a part of you feels that I am reading this to you. I didn't complete this website in august no. The background and the cards placeholders and half of the letters would be done before my flight, I hope so.(update - no the site was way far from done lol. Its 26 november, 7:31pm. Thats 5am at home so you must be sleeping. Today was a bad day between us. Got into fight because I spoke to shivika. Hey ik you don't like it but my worry is reasonable here don't you think? I am soorry I called you dumb and not understanding because I wanted you to calm down and see it from my Pov.) Yk, while I was making this html page for you, I had a lot of ambitious ideas but then I realised I am not that good at front end desiging, which is your styling basically. 9th me did it better haha. Come to think of it, back then I dealt with the javascript stuff. Js deals with the interaction you do with the page like the buttons here. What happenes when I go there? What happenes when I do this? That stuff. I wanted to include many more cards for you but the way I structured my page back in august, I end forgetting my own spaghetti code and writing it again today from where I left, that would take some time so I had to suffice with 12 cards only. Sorry. I wanted to include so much into here but then I came to like what I made here for you and thought you would like this. Oh and yes the button below, thats your birthday present haha. Open it. Bet you gonna like it. Happy birthday Ani. Oh and yes.....only open when these match your mood ok? OKKKKKKK? Yes ok. <br>Love,<br>Mayank</p><br>

                        <button class = "button" type = "button" data-text = "Normally, I would ask you to just call and sleep with me on the phone. I like it when you do that you know. I feel secure that you are sleeping and if not in front of my eyes then in front of my ears as I can hear you breathing while asleep, if it makes sense. Lol, let me tell you the day eldon was over and you were sleeping on the call with me. He snors. And for once I literally thought fuck this girl snors? Then I heard the snors again and I was like oh its eldon down there. Yk, the best dream I ever had? You were sleeping in front of me and you looked so beautiful. Theres an album from 1975 which I can use as a quote here. Don't mind if I sound cheesy here lol. 'I like it when you sleep, for You are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of it'. Writing this reminds me to adjust the code so that it fits your phone's browser viewport cuz rn it is designed for laptop only and you surely not going to sleep with your laptop (update nov 28 4:25am, failed tremendously at adjusting the viewport cuz I forgot the pattern I wrote code in months ago and now its all over the place. Note to self and you in case you ever go into web development, whenever you develop a site from the ground , write the css (styling) code for the mobile viewport first. Thats a better practise. And now because of my stupid mistake, you can only properly access the website on laptop only. If you try opening it on your mobile, then its a spaghetti paste all over the wall. Sorry, the 9th me surely was better.).I want you to do one thing when you can't fall asleep. Count from 10 to zero. Take breathe between each count. Like 'nine' *breathe in*...'eight' *breahte out*. Start again when you hit zero. How it works is simple. I mean you must already know this. It keeps your brain from focussing on more stressing acitvities such as thinking or letting it wander around somewhere else. I mean suddenly you are thinking about winning a lottery and now you are wide awake from excitement. Get my point? I mean masturbating is the trick for boys that weakens the whole body but lets not get there haha. You should do yoga ani. Mindfullness or meditation. It will help you know. I used to do both back in my days in Chandigarh. You know one day when you and I slept together on the call , almost a month ago and the call lasted for 6 hours. That day didi woke me up in between of like 2 hours in and I shouted 'kya h sone do mujhe or ani ko'. Didi was like ha sojo tum dono ek sath. How dare she laugh lol. I am gonna snuggle you real tight girl. You better prepare for it. Theres no escapin it. You will fall asleep within seconds. God, I wish I was there to tuck you in. Tho I imagine, If we were to sleep together on the same bed, you and I would just fall asleep while talking and if not me then you at least cuz I do know your sleeping pattern. I will just look at you and admire your beauty while you are asleep. Don't mind me if you catch me carassing your cheeks while you are off ok? They are tempting as they are and then add you sleeping over it. I won't be able to control. I won't sleep before you do thats for sure. Gonna make sure this girl is sleeping safe and sound RIGHT? Just take the nearest pillow and wrap around it imagining it to be me alright? My arms will always be stretched for you ani. They will always wait for you snuggle in cuz...well the arms are starting to believe that this place between them belongs to you and you only. I will always be there on the left ani. Always. Hey yk , one day I would like to say good night and good morning on the same call yk. Hehe *Perfect by Ed Sheeran cues*">Open when you can't fall asleep</button>

Even when you are all by yourself there ani, my love and thought for you will always be there with you. Tho I will say, being in a solace sometimes is not bad. Take this opportunity to do some inner reflection. Ik you like being alone, but don't let yourself get eaten away by your thoughts ani. If theres anything ever bothering you, just come and tell me. or hey, read the book that I gave ya or just ask me, dont forget I am a book nerd. I have so many novels and books under my belt. You are a leader ani, they always find their way out and help leading others. Always do that. I am proud of you. You will always be my pride. We will do a lot of shit together yar. All day long.

                        <button class = "button" type = "button" data-text = "I swear I remember the day when I wrote that fun speech on sex back then. You laughed so much. Well at least on the text you were all laughing emoji. Let me tell you what happened once while I was talking with you. We were yk exchanging snaps. We were flirting and all and I was making gestures with my hands. Yk like kissing you or touching you. That sort of. My dadi came into the room and saw me doing it. I immediately stopped recording the snaps but she was smugging like old thug life she lives. She mimicked the hand gestures I was doing and asked kya h ye. She was smiling as if she knew. No, she didn't know but she knew I was doing something with you so she was there to tease me. Cheeky old lady she is. So I dismissed it saying it was nothing. Later on in front of papa mumma she asked again, ye kya kr rha tha tu din me. I was on the bed with papa while dadi was with mumma on couching cutting vegetables. The moment she brought it up, I ninjad my way to the couch table, grabbed her hand and took her into the other room where I asked her to not do this ever again. She laughed and said thik h baba. Papa asked mumma asked but it was easy to cover it up. Now 2 months later, my dadi growing old with weak memory, asked again. This lady was unconscious all day, I drove the car all the way to her. She got up , asked abhi kha h. I said am right here. Talked for 2 minutes. Chachu and his family all around us, she asked 'abhi tu wo kya krta rhta h' as she gestures in the air. Chachi was in the kitchen. Rachit and chachu the sly son of a gun they are began smiling. Rachit left the room and sanvi was lost on her own.  Abhi kya bat kr rhe h ye dadi. I said kuch ni. Abhi hosh aya h to hallucinate kra hoga. Thik hojenge. Took off weeks later. In canada, surely she has forgottent about it. 3 week ago, abhi kya krta tha tu wo. I swear I know when this woman is in the mood of joking but she is not. She literally forgets it everytime and thinks I do it everyday. God it was so embarassing. and no it wasn't the gesture of fapping no.  please. Man its wild. She will skip her meals but ik for one that shes never going to stop wonder what mayank did with ani that day. oh and oh do you know when we used to talk during back when I was doing ielts, I used to tell you all about omw back home in the bus. So when I got home, you called. I think that was the first time you called, beside the very first day we were on snapchat call running after ojash. But anyways, So you called but we talked for 3 minutes. Monu bhaiya was there and didi too they saw the contact name 'ani' and bhaiya having the good ol genes inherited from mamu, he was messing with me all over the world. And none of us knew mamu was in the next room. We 3 thought we were all alone because mamu was taking uber instead of his car for the past week. Mamu quickly heard that it was a gossip about his bhanja so how could he miss it. He came and was 'oh mere puttr ka vyah yhi karenge' called mami who was there in the other room too and said 'oh veena deepu ko phone lagao ,uske budhe hone se phle gol rotia milenge usi'. The whole atmosphere that day was wild at my mamu's place. During dinner time I was in vc with mumma papa and di and mamu said 'deepu teri bhau ke lie tune jo anghutia rkhi hui h le aa un sbhi ko'. I was so embarassed that day but I was having a laugh too. So no there weren't thoughts of you and me marrying only when we got together no. Mamu was the first one who got the idea lol. I never told you this because I completely forgot about this until today when I am writing this, mamu joked in the family call 'pichle sal jb lado mere pas tha mene shadi kradeni thi iski. ab bhugto budha budhi. ladka bhi gya dur na bhau ani ab'. my mamu on one hand is the scariest person to all my siblings in the family. and then to me hes like this. gotta love it">Open when you wanna laugh</button>

Yk back then at mcd, I never thought that this could possibly be the last time I would be seeing you for couple of years from now. Kinda regret that day. A lot actually. So many things I could have done better. So many plans I made but never made a move cuz I was too shy. Can't go back to change it, but know that if I had the power, I would have made that day the best one of your life I swear to god. haha idk where this confidence is coming from but Ik I would have made your day to remember.

I don't remember ojash showing me a pic of you but when we exchanged snaps and instagram, I think the first the time I saw you was when you showed me your outfit. It was either the crop top you made yourself or the white shirt you were wearing to a party and the snaps in between.  Yes wait I remember when I first saw you, it was the snap you made of you and your mumma talking about ojash. Yes. I was travelling to chd for ielts when you sent me that. My first impressions of your face was based on the eyes. Found them beautiful. And your sharp nose. You had short hairs. Always loved them because they looked beautiful on you, yes I do ask you to increase their lenght but thats another topic. I never had a photo of you in my gallery until like when you showed me the crop top and one which shows your side profile which I saved in my gallery. After I was back from chd, you stopped sharing that many snaps. Didnt see you that much. But whenever you sent one in between , I always looked how creative you get with your hairs. Always loved them. When I was in goa picking up the bracelet, I first had chosen the type which had colorful stones. I imagined you wearing it in your hand and you looked beautiful in that. I ended up buying the one I sent you because that lock and keys kinda grew on me. And then on the day we met, when I saw you smiling walking towards me, I was in love. Hey, that moment, I knew I was in love. I had all those butterflies tumbling. All the plans I made, I am too shy for them now. I was looking at you. Your hairs. Your eyes. I was seeing you with my eyes and not photos. You looked more beautiful than in the photos. And I was stealing looks. I wanted to hug you but I was shy, doing a handshake and feeling your warmth did put a warm smile on me. That day, you were simple.....and that was enough. Jeans and a white tshirt and the best smile I ever saw in the world. That was enough for you to imprint yourself on me. and then later that day, you showed me so many pics of your hairs and you looked beautiful in every one of them. Yk I saved those pics the moment you saved them. So later on when you stopped talking before disabling the account, I was looking at you in my gallery and wanted to ask something and now ur id wasnt there anymore. Over the next month, the pics u had sent they failed to load anymore tho thankfully I had saved them. I was missing you. Didnt have the pic we took outside mcd. Wanted to see more of you. And then I saw more. You were beautiful everytime. Those jhumkas and the kurtas, you did numbers on me. That lehnga you wore when you went to your village and then that yellow kurta, I dont have the pics of the yellow kurta sadly. You were turning me on haha. You are just beautiful. Never failed to turn me on when you sat there in front of me in vcs wearing tank tops. Remember when you sent me ur pic when you were in hotel in bhopal? I wanted to compliment you so much but didnt want to make you feel uncomfortable in case it would. The best thing will always be the smile you carry ani. That alone makes you the most beautiful woman I have in my life and thats never changing. And hey I like your boobs ok? What was that about weeks ago huh? You think I look at others when you have the best pair that I have ever seen huh :p? Shut up. You turn me on. Thats it.  ">Open when you feel less than beautiful</button>

I was in 10th and I just began using reddit. I still recommend you that app. Its just the bad reputation it has because of nothing. Theres a place for everything there. Anyways, so on reddit I saw a post that said a male catfish was turned into a female using soy compounds. Yes now ik ki soy contains plants based estrogen. But that it is never compatible with the one we make in our bodies. But I saw very mixed reactions on it.  Some agreed some didn't. I stopped having it for few months until I was like fuck it idc. and then later on when I began gym after 12th, I researched every food I could use and then I learned that its just a fluke. It wont increase estrogen in me and give me breasts lol. So yeah, just trust your instincts. I will be there to help you to make the right decision anyways alright?">Open when you feel confused</button>
